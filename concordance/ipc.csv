It creates a hierarchical system of language-independent symbols for the classification of patents and utility models according to the different technical fields to which they belong. The classification system containts symbols or codes that can be allotted to patent documents. Symbols are arranged in eight sections corresponding to very broad technical fields (e.g., Section C deals with chemistry and metallurgy).","2236241","1","20",,"IPC",,"International patent classification (IPC) -

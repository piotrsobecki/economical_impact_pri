To estimate the economic impact of public research institutes, we have used concordance tables to map the IPC classification of over 30,000 patent admissions to NACE categories. 

The data has been obtained from the public APIs of the:
- [Integrated System of Information on Science and Higher Education (POLON)](https://polon.nauka.gov.pl/siec-polon)  
- ['UrzÄ…d Patentowy Reczpospolitej Polskiej' webiste](https://uprp.gov.pl/).

The collected data mapped with NACE mappings allows to see which industries are being impacted by the research conducted at these institutes. Our analysis is based on this mapping, which provides a detailed and accurate picture of the economic impact of the patenting activity of these institutes.

The following table presents distribution of all patent submissions in the collected database

While our analysis includes all patenting activity, not all of the patents that we have analyzed are currently active. 
This means that our results provide a comprehensive view of the impact of these institutes on the economy, even if some of the patents have expired or are no longer in use.

Our data and visualizations allow us to identify the industries that are being impacted the most by the research conducted at public research institutes.

Overall no distinct trend in distribution of patents impact on NACE sectors has been observed over the years.
